IT628: Systems Programming, Winter 2025-26
Course handout

Practicals:  TBA
Prerequisites: programming in C

Course abstract

All operating systems provide services for application programs they run. The service
points through which programs request services are called system calls. Both system
calls and library functions exist to provide services to application programs. A library
function may invoke one or more system calls and in many cases perform the same
action as a system call. However, it is important to realize that the library functions may
be replaced if desired, whereas the system calls usually cannot be replaced. This course
provides an introduction to the system calls for performing essentials tasks like
managing processes, files, memory and network communication.

Topics to be covered

Process management: programs and processes, creating processes, waiting
for processes, executing new programs, zombies, Unix shells.

Signals: Sending signals, signal handlers, signal blocking, signal sets, job-
control signals, non-local jumps.

I/O management: file abstraction, file descriptors, file access, file permissions,
reading directories standard I/O: buffering, implementation using low-level
I/O, I/O redirection.

Inter-process communication: pipes, non-blocking reads and writes, shared
memory.

Threads: differences between processes and threads, creating threads,
terminating threads, reaping terminated threads, detaching threads.

Concurrency: race conditions, locking, semaphores, synchronization with
semaphores, producer-consumer problem.

Sockets: types of connection, addressing, creation of transport end point,
sending and receiving messages.

Learning outcomes
At the end of the course, students will

Be familiar with the design and implementation of Unix shells

Be familiar with writing programs that create, manage and terminate processes
and threads on UNIX.

Be familiar with the relationship between standard I/O and low-level I/O.

Be familiar with the problems that may arise because of concurrent execution of
multiple processes or threads.

Be familiar with using sockets to implement interprocess communication.

Evaluation (tentative)

Two in-semester tests and a final exam will take place at the officially scheduled exam
time for the course.


35%     mid-term exams

35%     final exam

20%     in-lab exercises

10%     homework

Lab policy


Lab attendance is mandatory. You will have to demonstrate your code for the in-
lab exercises to a TA as specified in the lab handout. If you fail to do so, you will
lose points. There will be no makeup labs for any reason.


It is a course requirement that you do the programming assignments on Linux
OS. If the code you submit does not compile on Linux or we are unable to run the
executable, you will not receive credit.
