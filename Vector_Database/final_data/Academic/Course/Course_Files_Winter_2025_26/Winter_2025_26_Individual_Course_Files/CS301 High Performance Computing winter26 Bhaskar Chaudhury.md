Objectives/
Brief Course
Description
This course aims to provide a systems perspective towards achieving the
maximum possible performance out of a particular computing system for a
particular algorithm/ problem.
This course is an introduction to parallel computing and aims at teaching basic
models of parallel programming including the principles of parallel algorithm
design, modern processor and parallel computer architectures, performance
considerations, programming models for shared and distributed-memory
systems, message passing programming models used for cluster computing
etc. as well as design of some important scientific and engineering algorithms
for parallel systems.
Important aspects of OpenMP and MPI programming are covered in the
course, and lab-assignments are designed accordingly focussed on
implementation of important parallel kernels on shared and distributed
memory systems.
Evaluation/
Grading Policy
•
3 Exams: Two In-sems and Final End-Sem examination
•
8-9 Lab Assignments: A major part of the course includes Lab
Component for actual implementation after learning the basics of
Parallel programming and HPC.
Grading scheme is relative and depends on both: class performance and
minimum expectation from a student.
Mid-Sem-1 - 15%; Mid-Sem-2 - 20%;  End-Sem-30%, Lab Assignment-
30%, Lab Attendance-5%
