Course Overview
 Autonomous systems are machines that can perform tasks and operate in an
environment independently without human intervention and control. The
autonomous systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), autonomous cars,
wheel, and legged robots, etc., can potentially replace humans from dull, dangerous,
and dirty tasks. Therefore, the development and control of autonomous systems is a
rapidly-growing field and highly applied in the industries.
The course intends to develop an understanding of dynamics of robot manipulators,
mobile robots, and drones (quadrotors, AGVs, AUVs), controls for robotic systems
for motion-planning, collision avoidance, trajectory optimization, grasping and
manipulating objects. The course will include simulations related to dynamics,
trajectory generation, motion planning, and control of autonomous systems, such as
robots, manipulators and drones. This course will introduce the fundamental and
algorithmic principles behind the dynamics and control of autonomous systems.
The course will also allow students to get hands-on experience through project-
based assignments with the wheeled robot and quadrotor.

Introduction
Intro to autonomous systems, control, and robotics. Course
overview and motivation.

The first module will introduce the autonomous systems and
their functions, operations, and application areas. It will also
introduce control systems, a stream of engineering that
studies how to control and analyse any engineering system.
• Course introduction, Autonomous systems and
Autonomous robots

System
Dynamics
Transfer Function and state-space models, stability, MIMO,
modeling of robots/quadrotors/AUVs.
The behaviour of any engineering system can be understood
using its dynamics. The process of obtaining the dynamics
of a system is called modelling. In this module, we will
learn how to represent the dynamical systems, such as a

robots and quadrotors with mathematical models, and
analyse their stability.  Specific topics include -
• Transfer Functions (continuous and discrete-time
systems)
• State Space representation (continuous and discrete-
time systems)
• Nonlinear systems and their representation,
• Equilibrium points and other relevant system
properties
• Multi-input, multi-output systems
• Models of dynamical systems – quadrotors, AUVs

Feedback
Control
PID, time/frequency analysis, state-feedback, LQR,
tracking, compensators, inversion.
The feedback control is continuously monitoring the
performance of the controlled system and taking corrective
actions if there is a deviation between desired and performed
tasks. In this module, firstly, we will learn about how
feedback control affects the dynamics, i.e. behaviour, of a
system. Then, some well-known control techniques like
Proportional- Derivative-Integral (PID) control and Linear
quadratic (LQ) control will be studied. Specific topics
include -
• Time Domain Specifications
• Frequency Domain Specifications
• PID Control
• State-feedback based control, LQR
• Set-point tracking
• Inversion-based Control

Motion
Planning
Dijkstra, A*, optimal and dynamic planning. Application to
mobile robots/drones.
Motion planning, also known as Path Planning, is an
algorithm that describes the motion of a robot between two
points and produces commands such that the robots have
safe and optimal motion. In this module, techniques, and
algorithms, such as Discrete planning, Optimal planning,
and planning with dynamic constraints.
Specific topics include -

State
Estimation
Kalman and Bayes filters, state uncertainty and estimation
for control and planning.
A robot’s control and motion planning are possible when its
current state, i.e. position, speed and orientation, are known.
Often these states of a robot are not available and require
estimation. This module will teach state estimation
techniques such as Kalman and Bayes filters.

Localization
& Mapping
SLAM, mapping unknown environments, localization in
robots and quadrotors.
An autonomous system often has to work in an unknown
environment. SLAM is the computational technique of
constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment
while simultaneously keeping track of its location within it.
This module will teach about Localization, Mapping,
Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and their
practical application in mobile robots and quadrotors.
