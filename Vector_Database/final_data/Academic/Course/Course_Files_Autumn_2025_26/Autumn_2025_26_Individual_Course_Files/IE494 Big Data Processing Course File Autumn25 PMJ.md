IE494, Big Data Processing (Autumn’2025)
Course Placement: B.Tech. (ICT), Technical Elective, Semester – VII
Course format: 3 Lecture hours and 2 Lab hours.
Course Instructor: PM Jat, 2203, Faculty Block 2
Course Content:
Data has taken a different shape in today’s time. Modern applications and devices
produce data that is very huge, unstructured, and cannot be fitted into the fixed schema.
Such data, referred to as "Big Data" does not fit well in conventional storage and
processing systems.
A whole new set of techniques and technologies are emerging to process such data. This
course teaches various techniques that are used for storing and manipulating "Big Data".
Labs and Assignments:
There would be a series of lab exercises aimed to practice concepts learned in theory.
Students will also be required to either do a project or a term paper.
Evaluation plan:
1. Two Mid Semester Exams: 30%
2. Project/Term Paper: 20%
3. Lab Evaluation: 20%
4. End Semester evaluation: 30%
Course Outcomes:
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to
 Explain why traditional data processing techniques do not work on big data
problems.
 Work on some of the popular large data processing frameworks like Hadoop,
spark, and some NoSQL databases.
 Able to perform various operations like filtering, projecting, aggregation, and
OLAP queries on large datasets.
 Appreciate Storage, Indexing, and query execution techniques for big data
processing
