DS614 Big Data Engineering (Winter ’2026)
Instructor: Ankush Chander, 3209, Faculty Block-3
Credit Structure (L-T-P-Cr): 3-0-2-4
Course Placement: M.Sc Data Science, Semester-III
Course content:
This course aims to equip students with a deep understanding of the architectural and theoretical foundations of big data systems, moving from storage internals
(LSM-Trees, B-Trees) to modern Data Lakehouse architectures. It establishes a rigorous framework for distributed computing, examining replication, partitioning,
and consistency models (CAP, PACELC) required for fault tolerance. Students will develop engineering proficiency in designing orchestrated batch and streaming
pipelines while mastering probabilistic algorithms (HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch) for large-scale approximation. Finally, the course emphasizes reliability
engineering, inculcating best practices for data quality, schema governance, and observability in production environments.
Course uses lab and project work to ensure the balance between theory and practice, ideas and their application.

1.  Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
2. Fundamentals of Data Engineering by Joe Reis and Matt Housley
Analyze complex distributed storage requirements to select optimal data architectures (Lakehouse vs. Warehouse) based on trade-offs between consistency,
availability, and latency.
Design scalable data ingestion and orchestration systems that integrate batch and streaming data (Kafka/Airflow) to meet specified throughput and latency
constraints.
Apply mathematical principles of distributed computing and probabilistic algorithms (HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch) to solve large-scale cardinality and
frequency estimation problems.
Evaluate the impact of partitioning, replication, and concurrency control strategies on system fault tolerance and linearizability in distributed environments.
Develop automated data governance and reliability mechanisms (schema contracts, observability) that address professional responsibilities regarding data
quality and integrity.
