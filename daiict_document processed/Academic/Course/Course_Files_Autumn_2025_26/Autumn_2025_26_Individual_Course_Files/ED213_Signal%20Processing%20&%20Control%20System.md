Course Abstract:- The main objective of this course is to conduct a study on fundamental aspects
of signals and systems. This course is the gateway to many important courses at undergraduate
and postgraduate level such as Analog and Digital Communication Systems (in fact there
cannot be any communication without fundamental knowledge of this course), Digital
Signal Processing (DSP), Advanced DSP, Digital Image Processing, VLSI Signal Processing,
Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Radar Signal Processing, Acoustics, Speech
Communication, Seismology, Circuit Design, Control System Engineering, Robotics,  chemical
process control, , etc. In fact, the scope of potential and actual applications of the methods of
signals and system analysis continues to expand as engineers are confronted with the new
challenges involving the synthesis or analysis of complex processes. For these reasons a course in
signals and systems not only is an essential element in an engineering program but also can be of
the most rewarding, exciting, and useful courses that engineering student take during their
engineering education.

   The course is designed by keeping in mind to develop in parallel the methods of analysis of
continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems so that students can use computers to
develop and implement signals and systems algorithm. This approach also offers a distinct and
extremely important pedagogical advantage. Specifically, we are able to draw on the similarities
between continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems methods in order to share insights
and intuition developed in each domain. Similarly, we can exploit the difference between them to
sharpen an understanding of the distinct properties of each.

Course Outline: - The course first builds up fundamentals and introduction of signals and systems
ranging from their types, properties and different examples. The course then discusses extremely
useful class of systems, viz., linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and their representation with the
help of convolution sum (which can used to model many physical processes).  Fourier analysis
ranging from Fourier series, Fourier transform, time and frequency characterization is discussed in
a greater depth followed by study on Shannon’s sampling theory. The course then shifts to Z-
transform and Laplace transform with detailed discussion on properties and their applications. The
course also discusses in detail design of digital resonators and their applications in addition to
discussion on application of signals and systems methods to control systems and communication
systems.
